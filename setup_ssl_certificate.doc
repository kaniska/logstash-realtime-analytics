    Try downloading this file and building it:
    https://github.com/driskell/log-courier/blob/develop/src/lc-tlscert/lc-tlscert.go

    go build lc-tlscert.go will build the certificate

    If we connect using an IP address then the certificate MUST contain a matching IP SAN to pass validation.

    The above program will ask for additional DNS names and IP addresses. It will add an IP SAN to the resulting certificate and it should work.

    The program is based on Go's own certificate generator it uses to test TLS so should be good.

    Specify CN = *  and specify both DNS and IP of connecting server.

    Add additional SAN to the certificate, one for each name. Or, connect via FQDN (es101.logstash.domain, es102.logstash.domain...) and have a single wildcard certificate (*.logstash.domain).

    You then share that key pair across the platform in each logstash-forwarder .

    ./lc-tlscert 
    Specify the Common Name for the certificate. The common name
    can be anything, but is usually set to the server's primary
    DNS name. Even if you plan to connect via IP address you
    should specify the DNS name here.

    Common name: you_domain_or_whatever

    The next step is to add any additional DNS names and IP
    addresses that clients may use to connect to the server. If
    you plan to connect to the server via IP address and not DNS
    then you must specify those IP addresses here.
    When you are finished, just press enter.

    DNS or IP address 1: 172.17.42.1 (th ip address to trust)
    DNS or IP address 2: 

    How long should the certificate be valid for? A year (365
    days) is usual but requires the certificate to be regenerated
    within a year or the certificate will cease working.

    Number of days: 3650
    Common name: what_ever
    DNS SANs:
        None
    IP SANs:
        172.17.42.1

    The certificate can now be generated
    Press any key to begin generating the self-signed certificate.

    Successfully generated certificate
        Certificate: selfsigned.crt
        Private Key: selfsigned.key

    Copy and paste the following into your Log Courier
    configuration, adjusting paths as necessary:
        "transport": "tls",
        "ssl ca":    "path/to/selfsigned.crt",

    Copy and paste the following into your LogStash configuration, 
    adjusting paths as necessary:
        ssl_certificate => "path/to/selfsigned.crt",
        ssl_key         => "path/to/selfsigned.key",
